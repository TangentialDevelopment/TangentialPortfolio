    <h2>Initial Ideation</h2>
    <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
    <p>How to quickly and efficiently be prepared in the morning with the proper attire in such a way that users could explore the full extent of their closet.</p>
    <h3>Common Themes of User Interviews:</h3>
    <p>Instant gratification - in terms of the fact that we often seek our own opinion on outfits while out shopping and if it looks good to us we don’t want to wait around for opinions, too inconvenient i.e. especially while in a rush</p>
    <p>Outfit items/choices are commonly hidden & limited the way our closets are built (most of the people we interviewed don’t have walk-in closets)</p>
    <p>Time constraints - different times and days of the week often prevent people from picking out exactly what they needed or wanted to wear</p>
    <p>Comfort over style - some people prioritize what they wear on how comfortable they are in it rather than how it looks on them!</p>

    <h3>Final Ideation</h3>
    <p>This is a hanger that tracks data of clothing. User can use an interactive keypad to record how old the clothing item that pair well with this peice, record last wach dates etc. This hanger could also feature an alert, that tracked how many times the clothing item was taken off the hanger and worn.</p>
